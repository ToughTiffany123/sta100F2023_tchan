## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
pain<-read_csv("data/pain.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(pain)
```

#(a) Find the overall mean of pain tolerance, regardless of hair color.
```{r}
mean(pain$Score)
```

#(b) Find the overall standard deviation of pain tolerance, regardless of hair color.
```{r}
sd(pain$Score)
```

#(c) Find the mean pain tolerance for the category Dark-Brunette. Hint: Use R to find the mean for each group.
```{r}
pain_dark_brunette<-pain %>% 
  filter(HairColor=="DarkBrunette")
mean(pain_dark_brunette$Score)
```
```{r}
aggregate(Score~HairColor,pain,mean)
```

#(d) Find the standard deviation of pain tolerance for the category LightBrunette. Hint: Use R to find the standard deviation for each group.
```{r}
aggregate(Score~HairColor,pain,sd)
```

#(e) Find the number of subjects that were in the category LightBlond. Hint: Use R to find the number of subjects for each group.
```{r}
aggregate(Score~HairColor,pain,length)
```

#(f) Which hair color category had the highest average pain tolerance?
#Light Blondes had the highest average pain tolerance.

#(g) Which hair color category had the lowest standard deviation of pain tolerance?
#Light Brunettes had the lowest standard deviation of pain tolerance.

#(h) Which hair color category had the most subjects?
#Dark Blonde,Dark Brunette, and Light Blonde tied for having most subjects
